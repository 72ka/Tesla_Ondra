# Ondra+ 16kB ROM

Homebrew 16kB ROM based on SSM-ROM Â´87 including modified BASIC EXP v5.0G named SSM BASIC.
 
You can read the development story in [this article](http://www.ondraspo186.8u.cz/?p=656) (Czech language)

### Docs

I've created a user manual which is the same look as the Ondra's SSM manuals. See the PDF file in the directory.

### Installation

Just burn the *.bin files to two 2764 EPROMS and put them in Ondra. Don't forget to switch your Ondra to use 16kB chips - short junctions B-C instead of A-B.

### Video preview

Here you can see this ROM in action, even with the remote control of SP210 data recorder.
