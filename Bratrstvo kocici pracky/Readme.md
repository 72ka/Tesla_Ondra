# Bratrstvo kočičí pracky

 Game for the famous czechoslovak home computer [TESLA Ondra SPO186](http://www.ondraspo186.8u.cz/ "Tento web se zabývá československým počítačem Tesla Ondra SPO 186")
 
 This game is port of the original version by Petr Kain.
 
Ondra is getting his second text game, which promises a thrilling adventure full of challenges. After the famous game Město Robotů, where you raced around a futuristic world in the shoes of an astronaut, comes Bratrstvo kočičí pracky. This time you will be transported back in time, directly to pre-war Prague in 1938, where you will find yourself in a negative role - Dlouhé Bidlo, the exact opposite of Mirek Dušín. Your goal? Defeat the Rychlé šípy in a race that will decide the fate of the brotherhood. And at any cost!

This game is only for SSM (ViLi) ROM and its derivatives (e.g. Ondra+)
